### Note
We moved our Git repository to [here](https://github.com/modi-karan/Autonomous-Air-Traffic-Controller) due to permissions problems. That is the updated repository and hosts all our files.

### DESCRIPTION AND GOALS

Description: Autonomous ATC will coordinate several quadrotors trying to simulate a TRACON environment. The quadrotors will be asked to follow a preset series of waypoints. Goal is to also establish communication giving commands similar to ATC directives like holding, new routing etc.

Goals: For the project, Autonomous ATC will simulate following situations :
* Sequential take-off and landing
* Parallel take-off and landing
* Emergency landings
